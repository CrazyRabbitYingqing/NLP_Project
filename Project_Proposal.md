## NLP Project Proposal

### Question/Need:
For the NLP unsupervised learning project, I want to answer the question about the sentiment of the twitter users to Covid-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. With the sentiment analysis results, social scientists and psychologists can proceed with studies on how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events for the usage of future government policymaking.

### Data Description:
I plan to use a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)

The data set title: Coronavirus tweets NLP

The dataset including columns: Tweet Location, Time, Twitter Text, Sentiment Label

The entire dataset contains more than 40k unique Twitter texts that posted between mid-March to mid-April 2020

Supplemental data: Covid daily cases at the Tweet locations

I will use the dataset to build an unsupervised learning model including dimensionality reduction/topic modeling and clustering in Python.

Also, supervised modeling methods like some classification models will be practiced as a comparison.

### Tools:

Python text processing libraries/ tools: NLTK, spaCy, gensim, sklearn

Visualization: seaborn

### MVP Goal:
Performing preprocessing of the data and dimensionality reduction/topic modeling for first round and show some preliminary analysis with two plots.
