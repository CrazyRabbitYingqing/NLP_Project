## NLP Project Proposal

### Question/Need:
For the NLP unsupervised learning project, I want to answer the question about the sentiment of the twitter users to Covid-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. With the sentiment analysis results, social scientists and psychologists can proceed with studies on how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events for the usage of future government policymaking.
